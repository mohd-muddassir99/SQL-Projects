# 🏪 Store Inventory & Sales Analysis - SQL Case Study

## Introduction📌: 
This repository presents a comprehensive SQL-driven analysis of a store’s **inventory and sales data**, focusing on **multi-table queries, advanced joins, and complex data relationships**.

By leveraging SQL techniques, including multiple joins, nested queries, and data transformations, I extracted key business insights on stock levels, sales trends, product performance, and revenue analysis. The project showcases real-world inventory management strategies using SQL.

## Methodologies Used 🛠️:
- **Multi-Table Querying** – Combined 3-4 tables in single queries to derive meaningful insights.
- **Advanced SQL Joins** – Used LEFT, RIGHT, INNER, FULL, SELF, and NON-EQUI JOIN to analyze data.
- **Inventory Analysis** – Assessed stock availability, turnover rate, and replenishment needs.
- **Sales Performance Tracking** – Identified top-selling products, seasonal trends, and revenue drivers.
- **Customer Purchase Behavior** – Mapped customer preferences through sales history.
- **Pricing & Profitability Analysis** – Evaluated profit margins across different products.

## Potential Challenges⚡:
- **Handling Complex Joins** – Efficiently managing queries with multiple joins across large datasets.
- **Data Normalization Issues** – Ensuring proper relationships between inventory, sales, and customers.
- **Performance Optimization** – Improving execution time of nested queries and self-joins.
- **Stock vs. Demand Correlation** – Identifying patterns between inventory levels and customer demand.

## Key Insights💡:
- **Best-Selling & Low-Performing Products** – Found products with the highest and lowest demand.
- **Stock Management Challenges** – Identified items at risk of overstocking or running out-of-stock.
- **Seasonal Sales Trends** – Observed peak sales periods based on historical transaction data.
- **Profitability by Product Category** – Analyzed gross revenue and profit margins across categories.
- **Impact of Customer Behavior on Sales** – Mapped repeat purchases and preferred product categories.
