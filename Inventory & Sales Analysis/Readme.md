# 🏪 Store Inventory & Sales Analysis - SQL Case Study

## Introduction📌: 
This repository presents a comprehensive SQL-driven analysis of a store’s **inventory and sales data**, focusing on **multi-table queries, advanced joins, and complex data relationships**.

By leveraging SQL techniques, including multiple joins, nested queries, and data transformations, I extracted key business insights on stock levels, sales trends, product performance, and revenue analysis. The project showcases real-world inventory management strategies using SQL.

## Methodologies Used 🛠️:
- **Multi-Table Querying** – Combined 3-4 tables in single queries to derive meaningful insights.
- **Advanced SQL Joins** – Used LEFT, RIGHT, INNER, FULL, SELF, and NON-EQUI JOIN to analyze data.
- **Inventory Analysis** – Assessed stock availability, turnover rate, and replenishment needs.
- **Sales Performance Tracking** – Identified top-selling products, seasonal trends, and revenue drivers.
- **Customer Purchase Behavior** – Mapped customer preferences through sales history.
- **Pricing & Profitability Analysis** – Evaluated profit margins across different products.

## Potential Challenges⚡:
- **Handling Complex Joins** – Efficiently managing queries with multiple joins across large datasets.
- **Data Normalization Issues** – Ensuring proper relationships between inventory, sales, and customers.
- **Performance Optimization** – Improving execution time of nested queries and self-joins.
- **Stock vs. Demand Correlation** – Identifying patterns between inventory levels and customer demand.

## Key Insights💡:
- **Best-Selling & Low-Performing Products** – Found products with the highest and lowest demand.
- **Stock Management Challenges** – Identified items at risk of overstocking or running out-of-stock.
- **Seasonal Sales Trends** – Observed peak sales periods based on historical transaction data.
- **Profitability by Product Category** – Analyzed gross revenue and profit margins across categories.
- **Impact of Customer Behavior on Sales** – Mapped repeat purchases and preferred product categories.

## 🎯 Recommendations & Future Scope
After analyzing the data, the recommended top three cities for new store openings are:

### City 1: Pune
1. Average rent per customer is very low.
2. Highest total revenue.
3. Average sales per customer is also high.

### City 2: Delhi
1. Highest estimated coffee consumers at 7.7 million.
2. Highest total number of customers, which is 68.
3. Average rent per customer is 330 (still under 500).
   
### City 3: Jaipur
1. Highest number of customers, which is 69.
2. Average rent per customer is very low at 156.
3. Average sales per customer is better at 11.6k.
