# 🏪 Store Inventory & Sales Analysis - SQL Case Study

## Introduction📌: 
This repository presents a comprehensive SQL-driven analysis of a store’s **inventory and sales data**, focusing on **multi-table queries, advanced joins, and complex data relationships**.

By leveraging SQL techniques, including multiple joins, nested queries, and data transformations, I extracted key business insights on stock levels, sales trends, product performance, and revenue analysis. The project showcases real-world inventory management strategies using SQL.

## Methodologies Used 🛠️:
- **Multi-Table Querying** – Combined 3-4 tables in single queries to derive meaningful insights.
- **Advanced SQL Joins** – Used LEFT, RIGHT, INNER, FULL, SELF, and NON-EQUI JOIN to analyze data.
- **Inventory Analysis** – Assessed stock availability, turnover rate, and replenishment needs.
- **Sales Performance Tracking** – Identified top-selling products, seasonal trends, and revenue drivers.
- **Customer Purchase Behavior** – Mapped customer preferences through sales history.
- **Pricing & Profitability Analysis** – Evaluated profit margins across different products.

## Potential Challenges⚡:
- **Estimating Consumer Demand** – Approximate coffee consumption patterns based on city demographics.
- **Data Consistency Issues** – Ensuring uniform date formats, transaction records, and customer IDs.
- **Handling Growth Rate Calculations** – Computing percentage change in sales over different months.
- **Multi-Dimensional Data Analysis** – Balancing sales, rent, and population data to derive meaningful insights.


## Key Insights💡:
- **High Coffee Demand in Populated Cities** – More consumers drive higher sales, but competition also increases.
- **Top Products by Region** – Certain coffee products perform better in specific cities, indicating local preferences.
- **Revenue vs. Cost Dynamics** – High-rent cities may not always be the most profitable for coffee businesses.
- **Sales Seasonality** – Monthly sales trends reveal peak and off-peak periods for coffee consumption.
- **Market Potential Identified** – The top three cities with the highest sales offer strong expansion opportunities.

## 🎯 Recommendations & Future Scope
After analyzing the data, the recommended top three cities for new store openings are:

### City 1: Pune
1. Average rent per customer is very low.
2. Highest total revenue.
3. Average sales per customer is also high.

### City 2: Delhi
1. Highest estimated coffee consumers at 7.7 million.
2. Highest total number of customers, which is 68.
3. Average rent per customer is 330 (still under 500).
   
### City 3: Jaipur
1. Highest number of customers, which is 69.
2. Average rent per customer is very low at 156.
3. Average sales per customer is better at 11.6k.
