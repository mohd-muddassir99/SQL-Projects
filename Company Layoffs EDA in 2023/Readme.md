# 🏆 Company Layoffs 2023 Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis

## Introduction📌: 
This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Layoffs data** using **SQL**, where I have **examined workforce trends, industry impacts, and company-specific layoffs**. By leveraging SQL queries and analytical techniques, I extracted key insights on layoffs across various industries, years, and companies.

Through this analysis, I explored **statistical summaries, running totals, rankings, and company earnings**, providing a data-driven perspective on employment trends and economic shifts.
