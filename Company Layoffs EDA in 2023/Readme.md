# 🏆 SQL Data Cleaning & Analysis

## Introduction📌: 
This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Layoffs data** using **SQL**, where I have **examined workforce trends, industry impacts, and company-specific layoffs**. By leveraging SQL queries and analytical techniques, I extracted key insights on layoffs across various industries, years, and companies.

Through this analysis, I explored **statistical summaries, running totals, rankings, and company earnings**, providing a data-driven perspective on employment trends and economic shifts.

## Methodologies Used 🛠️:
- ✔ **Statistical Summary** – Generated key metrics to understand data distribution.
- **✔ Industry-Wise Analysis** – Examined layoffs and earnings across different sectors.
- **✔ Company & Year-Wise Breakdown** – Analyzed how layoffs varied by company and year.
- **✔ Running Total Calculation** – Tracked cumulative layoffs over time using window functions.
- **✔ Company-Wise Layoff Trends** – Identified top-affected companies and their layoff patterns.
- **✔ Ranking Using Window Functions** – Determined highest layoffs per company using RANK(), DENSE_RANK().
## Potential Challenges⚡:
- **🔹 Handling Incomplete Data** – Ensuring missing values do not impact analysis accuracy.
- **🔹 Maintaining Performance** – Query optimization for efficient data retrieval.
- **🔹 Data Structure Variability** – Adjusting transformations based on dataset-specific inconsistencies.

## Key Insights from SQL Data Cleaning & Analysis 💡:
- **1️⃣ Data Accuracy & Integrity**:- Ensuring unique records improves reliability in reporting and decision-making. Standardizing formats (e.g., date formats, text case, currency values) enhances consistency across datasets.
- **2️⃣ Impact of Data Cleaning on Analysis**:- Removing duplicates and unnecessary columns reduces data redundancy and improves performance. Handling NULL values and missing data ensures that calculations (averages, sums, aggregations) are accurate.
- **3️⃣ Performance Optimization & Query Efficiency**:- Using proper indexing and query optimization techniques enhances data retrieval speed. Applying WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY clauses effectively ensures efficient filtering and aggregation.
- **4️⃣ Data-Driven Insights for Decision-Making**:- Clean and structured data allows businesses to make informed and strategic decisions. Identifying trends and anomalies in customer behavior, sales, or financial transactions improves forecasting.
- **5️⃣ Handling Large Datasets Efficiently**:- Partitioning tables and optimizing joins help maintain query performance on large datasets. Avoiding *unnecessary computations (SELECT ) and using specific column selection reduces processing time.
