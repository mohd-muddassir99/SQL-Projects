# 🏆 SQL Data Cleaning & Analysis

## Introduction📌: 
This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Layoffs data** using **SQL**, where I have **examined workforce trends, industry impacts, and company-specific layoffs**. By leveraging SQL queries and analytical techniques, I extracted key insights on layoffs across various industries, years, and companies.

Through this analysis, I explored **statistical summaries, running totals, rankings, and company earnings**, providing a data-driven perspective on employment trends and economic shifts.

## Methodologies Used 🛠️:
- ✔ **Statistical Summary** – Generated key metrics to understand data distribution.
- **✔ Industry-Wise Analysis** – Examined layoffs and earnings across different sectors.
- **✔ Company & Year-Wise Breakdown** – Analyzed how layoffs varied by company and year.
- **✔ Running Total Calculation** – Tracked cumulative layoffs over time using window functions.
- **✔ Company-Wise Layoff Trends** – Identified top-affected companies and their layoff patterns.
- **✔ Ranking Using Window Functions** – Determined highest layoffs per company using RANK(), DENSE_RANK().

## Potential Challenges⚡:
- **Handling Missing & Inconsistent Data** – Ensuring data accuracy for meaningful insights.
- **Performance Optimization** – Optimizing queries for large datasets with millions of records.
- **Complexity in Time-Series Analysis** – Efficiently calculating running totals and trends over time.
- **Normalization & Standardization** – Ensuring uniform data formats across different companies and years.


## Key Insights from SQL Data Cleaning & Analysis 💡:
- **Layoffs Vary Significantly Across Industries** – Some sectors faced heavier workforce reductions than others.
- **Economic Trends & Company Earnings Impact Layoffs** – Companies with lower earnings often resorted to layoffs.
- **Peak Layoff Periods Identified** – Certain months and years had higher layoffs due to economic downturns.
- **Top Companies with the Highest Layoffs** – Identified using ranking techniques in SQL.
- **Running Totals Show Growth in Layoffs Over Time** – Tracking monthly layoffs revealed long-term trends.

## 🎯 Recommendations & Future Scope
- **Deeper Financial Analysis** – Correlate layoffs with company revenue, stock performance, and funding status.
- **Predictive Modeling** – Use SQL analysis as a foundation for machine learning-driven layoff predictions.
- **Visualization Integration** – Connect results with Power BI or Tableau for interactive dashboards.
- **Further Industry Breakdown** – Analyze layoffs based on company size, geography, and business model.
