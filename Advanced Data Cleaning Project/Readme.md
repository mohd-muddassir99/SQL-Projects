# 🏆 SQL Data Cleaning & Analysis

## Introduction📌: 
This repository showcases **SQL-driven data cleaning and analysis** techniques applied to various datasets. The focus is on preparing raw, messy data for meaningful analysis by removing inconsistencies, handling missing values, and structuring data efficiently. Using SQL, I have performed data transformation, pattern identification, and business insights extraction to support data-driven decision-making.

## Methodologies Used 🛠️:
- **Database Creation & Management**: Designing schemas, defining relationships, and inserting sample data.
- **Data Analysis Queries**: Using SQL Joins, Aggregate Functions, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY clauses.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying trends and insights through queries involving subqueries, CTEs, and window functions.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Enhancing query performance through indexing, execution plans, and query restructuring.

## Potential Challenges⚡:
- **Data Cleaning & Consistency**: Handling missing or duplicate data while maintaining data integrity.
- **Complex Query Optimization**: Balancing performance while dealing with large datasets and multiple joins.
- **Understanding Business Context**: Translating raw data into meaningful insights that drive decision-making.

## Key Insights 💡:
- **Data-driven Decision Making**: Extracting valuable trends and KPIs using SQL queries.
- **Improved Query Efficiency**: Understanding the impact of indexing and query structuring on performance.
- **Real-World Use Cases**: Implementing SQL-based solutions for business analytics, sales performance, customer segmentation, and financial transactions.
