# ☕ Monday Coffee Sales EDA - SQL Analysis

## Introduction📌: 
This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of **Coffee Sales** across various cities, leveraging SQL to **uncover consumer behavior, sales trends, and market potential**.

By analyzing sales data, population estimates, and rental costs, I derived meaningful insights into customer segmentation, revenue patterns, and growth trends. The goal is to understand demand, optimize sales strategies, and evaluate market opportunities using data-driven decision-making.

## Methodologies Used 🛠️:
- **Coffee Consumer Estimation** – Determined the number of coffee drinkers per city based on population.
- **Revenue Analysis** – Computed total and average sales revenue for different time periods.
- **Product Performance Analysis** – Evaluated sales volume per coffee product.
- **Customer Segmentation** – Identified unique buyers per city for targeted marketing.
- **Sales Growth Trends** – Measured monthly sales growth rate to track performance.
- **Market Potential Analysis** – Ranked top cities based on total sales, rental costs, and customer base.
- **Comparative Analysis (Sales vs Rent)** – Correlated customer spending with average rental expenses.

## Potential Challenges⚡:
- **Estimating Consumer Demand** – Approximate coffee consumption patterns based on city demographics.
- **Data Consistency Issues** – Ensuring uniform date formats, transaction records, and customer IDs.
- **Handling Growth Rate Calculations** – Computing percentage change in sales over different months.
- **Multi-Dimensional Data Analysis** – Balancing sales, rent, and population data to derive meaningful insights.


## Key Insights💡:
- **High Coffee Demand in Populated Cities** – More consumers drive higher sales, but competition also increases.
- **Top Products by Region** – Certain coffee products perform better in specific cities, indicating local preferences.
- **Revenue vs. Cost Dynamics** – High-rent cities may not always be the most profitable for coffee businesses.
- **Sales Seasonality** – Monthly sales trends reveal peak and off-peak periods for coffee consumption.
- **Market Potential Identified** – The top three cities with the highest sales offer strong expansion opportunities.

## 🎯 Recommendations & Future Scope
- **Deeper Financial Analysis** – Correlate layoffs with company revenue, stock performance, and funding status.
- **Predictive Modeling** – Use SQL analysis as a foundation for machine learning-driven layoff predictions.
- **Visualization Integration** – Connect results with Power BI or Tableau for interactive dashboards.
- **Further Industry Breakdown** – Analyze layoffs based on company size, geography, and business model.
