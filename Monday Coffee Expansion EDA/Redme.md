# ☕ Monday Coffee Sales EDA - SQL Analysis

## Introduction📌: 
This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of **Coffee Sales** across various cities, leveraging SQL to **uncover consumer behavior, sales trends, and market potential**.

By analyzing sales data, population estimates, and rental costs, I derived meaningful insights into customer segmentation, revenue patterns, and growth trends. The goal is to understand demand, optimize sales strategies, and evaluate market opportunities using data-driven decision-making.

## Methodologies Used 🛠️:
- **Coffee Consumer Estimation** – Determined the number of coffee drinkers per city based on population.
- **Revenue Analysis** – Computed total and average sales revenue for different time periods.
- **Product Performance Analysis** – Evaluated sales volume per coffee product.
- **Customer Segmentation** – Identified unique buyers per city for targeted marketing.
- **Sales Growth Trends** – Measured monthly sales growth rate to track performance.
- **Market Potential Analysis** – Ranked top cities based on total sales, rental costs, and customer base.
- **Comparative Analysis (Sales vs Rent)** – Correlated customer spending with average rental expenses.

## Potential Challenges⚡:
- **Handling Missing & Inconsistent Data** – Ensuring data accuracy for meaningful insights.
- **Performance Optimization** – Optimizing queries for large datasets with millions of records.
- **Complexity in Time-Series Analysis** – Efficiently calculating running totals and trends over time.
- **Normalization & Standardization** – Ensuring uniform data formats across different companies and years.


## Key Insights from SQL Data Cleaning & Analysis 💡:
- **Layoffs Vary Significantly Across Industries** – Some sectors faced heavier workforce reductions than others.
- **Economic Trends & Company Earnings Impact Layoffs** – Companies with lower earnings often resorted to layoffs.
- **Peak Layoff Periods Identified** – Certain months and years had higher layoffs due to economic downturns.
- **Top Companies with the Highest Layoffs** – Identified using ranking techniques in SQL.
- **Running Totals Show Growth in Layoffs Over Time** – Tracking monthly layoffs revealed long-term trends.

## 🎯 Recommendations & Future Scope
- **Deeper Financial Analysis** – Correlate layoffs with company revenue, stock performance, and funding status.
- **Predictive Modeling** – Use SQL analysis as a foundation for machine learning-driven layoff predictions.
- **Visualization Integration** – Connect results with Power BI or Tableau for interactive dashboards.
- **Further Industry Breakdown** – Analyze layoffs based on company size, geography, and business model.
