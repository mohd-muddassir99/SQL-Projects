# ☕ Monday Coffee Sales EDA - SQL Analysis

## Introduction📌: 
This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of **Coffee Sales** across various cities, leveraging SQL to **uncover consumer behavior, sales trends, and market potential**.

By analyzing sales data, population estimates, and rental costs, I derived meaningful insights into customer segmentation, revenue patterns, and growth trends. The goal is to understand demand, optimize sales strategies, and evaluate market opportunities using data-driven decision-making.

## Objective :
The business aims to expand by opening three coffee shops in India's top three major cities. Since its launch in January 2023, the company has successfully sold its products online and received an overwhelmingly positive response in several cities. As a data analyst, your task is to analyze the sales data and provide insights to recommend the top three cities for this expansion.

## Methodologies Used 🛠️:
- **Coffee Consumer Estimation** – Determined the number of coffee drinkers per city based on population.
- **Revenue Analysis** – Computed total and average sales revenue for different time periods.
- **Product Performance Analysis** – Evaluated sales volume per coffee product.
- **Customer Segmentation** – Identified unique buyers per city for targeted marketing.
- **Sales Growth Trends** – Measured monthly sales growth rate to track performance.
- **Market Potential Analysis** – Ranked top cities based on total sales, rental costs, and customer base.
- **Comparative Analysis (Sales vs Rent)** – Correlated customer spending with average rental expenses.

## Potential Challenges⚡:
- **Estimating Consumer Demand** – Approximate coffee consumption patterns based on city demographics.
- **Data Consistency Issues** – Ensuring uniform date formats, transaction records, and customer IDs.
- **Handling Growth Rate Calculations** – Computing percentage change in sales over different months.
- **Multi-Dimensional Data Analysis** – Balancing sales, rent, and population data to derive meaningful insights.


## Key Insights💡:
- **High Coffee Demand in Populated Cities** – More consumers drive higher sales, but competition also increases.
- **Top Products by Region** – Certain coffee products perform better in specific cities, indicating local preferences.
- **Revenue vs. Cost Dynamics** – High-rent cities may not always be the most profitable for coffee businesses.
- **Sales Seasonality** – Monthly sales trends reveal peak and off-peak periods for coffee consumption.
- **Market Potential Identified** – The top three cities with the highest sales offer strong expansion opportunities.

## 🎯 Recommendations & Future Scope
After analyzing the data, the recommended top three cities for new store openings are:

### City 1: Pune
1. Average rent per customer is very low.
2. Highest total revenue.
3. Average sales per customer is also high.

### City 2: Delhi
1. Highest estimated coffee consumers at 7.7 million.
2. Highest total number of customers, which is 68.
3. Average rent per customer is 330 (still under 500).
   
### City 3: Jaipur
